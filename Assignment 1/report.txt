1. Performance on the development data with 100% of the training data
1a. spam precision: 0.9931
1b. spam recall: 0.9774
1c. spam F1 score: 0.9859
1d. ham precision: 0.9467
1e. ham recall: 0.9833
1f. ham F1 score: 0.9468

2. Performance on the development data with 10% of the training data - (Random 10% Data was evenly taken from spam and ham)
2a. spam precision: 0.9137
2b. spam recall: 0.9883
2c. spam F1 score: 0.9495
2d. ham precision: 0.9642
2e. ham recall: 0.7713
2f. ham F1 score: 0.8570

3. Description of enhancement(s) you tried (e.g., different approach(es) to smoothing, treating common words differently, dealing with unknown words differently):
I tried the following enchancements: 
    1. Clubbed all numeric values under a single numeric tag.
    2. Tried Add k smoothing with k different K Values.
    3. Gave a small probability (1/total_words) to unknwon/unseen words.
    4. Calculated P(Spam) = total_spam_words/total_words and P(Ham) = total_ham_words/total_words - as shown in slides example

4. Best performance results based on enhancements. Note that these could be the same or worse than the standard implementation.
Best performance was found combining 1, 2 and 4.
Precision and F1 Score for spam dcreased a bit. However, Precision and F1 Score for ham increased
4a. spam precision: 0.9887
4b. spam recall: 0.9814
4c. spam F1 score: 0.9851
4d. ham precision: 0.95545
4e. ham recall: 0.9727
4f. ham F1 score: 0.9789
